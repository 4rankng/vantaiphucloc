## 3. Core Entities

### 3.1 Client (Khách hàng)

The companies or individuals that hire Phúc Lộc to transport containers.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| name | string | Client name |
| type | `company` \| `individual` | Business type |
| phone | string | Contact phone |
| tax_code | string? | Tax code (mã số thuế) |
| address | string? | Address |
| contact_person | string? | Contact person name |
| outstanding_debt | int (VND) | Amount owed to Phúc Lộc |

**Business Rules:**
- Cannot delete a client that has associated work orders or trip orders.
- `outstanding_debt` is a running total (currently not auto-updated — future: update when trip orders are invoiced).

### 3.2 Vendor (Nhà thầu)

External companies that provide drivers to Phúc Lộc. Internal drivers belong to "Phúc Lộc".

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| name | string (unique) | Vendor company name |

**Business Rules:**
- Cannot delete a vendor that has associated drivers.
- Default vendor for internal drivers: "Phúc Lộc".

### 3.3 Route (Tuyến đường)

Predefined transport routes with reference pricing by container size.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| route | string | Route name/description (e.g., "Cát Lái - Bình Dương") |
| type_20ft | int (VND) | Reference price for 20ft container |
| type_40ft | int (VND) | Reference price for 40ft container |
| is_two_way | boolean | Whether the route is round-trip |

**Business Rules:**
- Route reference prices are **guidelines only**. Actual prices come from the Pricing table per client.

### 3.4 Pricing (Bảng giá)

Per-client pricing agreement. Defines how much a specific client pays for a specific work type on a specific route, and how much the driver earns.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| client_id | int (FK) | Which client this price applies to |
| client_name | string | Denormalized for display |
| work_type | `E20` \| `E40` \| `F20` \| `F40` | Container type + load type |
| route | string | Route description |
| unit_price | int (VND) | Amount the client pays Phúc Lộc |
| driver_salary | int (VND) | Base driver pay per job |
| allowance | int (VND) | Additional driver allowance per job |
| lines | PricingLine[] | Sub-items with work_type + quantity |

**Work Types:**
| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| E20 | Container rỗng (empty) 20ft |
| E40 | Container rỗng (empty) 40ft |
| F20 | Container hàng (full/loaded) 20ft |
| F40 | Container hàng (full/loaded) 40ft |

**Business Rules:**
- Pricing is matched by `(client_id, work_type, route)`. When a driver creates a work order, the system auto-looks up the pricing.
- `unit_price` = revenue from client. `driver_salary` + `allowance` = driver cost. Profit = `unit_price - (driver_salary + allowance)`.
- PricingLines allow quantity breakdown (e.g., 2× E20 + 1× F40 in one pricing record).

### 3.5 Work Order (Phiếu làm việc)

Created by **drivers** in the field. Records the physical work done: which containers were moved, from/to where, GPS location.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| containers | ContainerItem[] | List of containers in this work order |
| client_id | int (FK, nullable) | Client (may be null for driver-created WOs — filled later by accountant) |
| client_name | string | Denormalized |
| route | string | Route description |
| driver_id | int (FK) | Driver who did the work |
| driver_name | string | Denormalized |
| tractor_plate | string | Truck plate number |
| gps_lat, gps_lng | float? | GPS coordinates at creation time |
| gps_address | string? | Reverse-geocoded address (async via worker) |
| unit_price | int (VND) | Auto-filled from Pricing if match found, else 0 |
| driver_salary | int (VND) | Auto-filled from Pricing if match found, else 0 |
| allowance | int (VND) | Auto-filled from Pricing if match found, else 0 |
| earning | int (VND) | = driver_salary + allowance |
| pricing_id | int (FK)? | Link to the Pricing record that matched |
| status | `PENDING` → `PRICED` → `MATCHED` | Lifecycle status |

**Container Item:**
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| container_number | string | Container ID (e.g., "MSKU-1234567") |
| work_type | WorkType | E20/E40/F20/F40 |
| photo_url | string? | Photo of the container |
| photo_lat, photo_lng | float? | GPS where photo was taken |
| photo_timestamp | datetime? | When photo was taken |

**Work Order Lifecycle:**
```
Driver creates WO → PENDING (no pricing match) or PRICED (pricing match found)
                          ↓
Accountant reconciles WO with a TripOrder → MATCHED
```

**Business Rules:**
- **Auto-pricing:** On creation, the system looks up `Pricing` by `(client_id, work_type, route)`. If found → status = `PRICED`, fills unit_price/driver_salary/allowance. If not found → status = `PENDING`, all financials = 0.
- **GPS capture:** Driver's GPS coordinates are captured at creation time. Background worker reverse-geocodes the address.
- **Offline support:** Drivers can create work orders offline. They are queued locally and synced when back online via `offlineQueue`. Batch creation supports up to 50 WOs at once.
- **One work order can have multiple containers** (e.g., a truck carrying 2 containers on one trip).
- When matched to a trip order, earning is recalculated from the trip order's `driver_salary + allowance`.

### 3.6 Trip Order (Lệnh điều hành)

Created by **accountants**. Represents the commercial/financial record of a trip — what the client is charged.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| trip_date | date | Date of the trip |
| client_id | int (FK) | Client being charged |
| client_name | string | Denormalized |
| work_type | WorkType | Container type |
| route | string | Route |
| tractor_plate | string | Truck plate |
| driver_id | int (FK) | Driver who drove |
| driver_name | string | Denormalized |
| container_number | string | Single container (one trip order = one container) |
| pricing_id | int (FK)? | Pricing used |
| unit_price | int (VND) | Revenue from client |
| driver_salary | int (VND) | Driver base pay |
| allowance | int (VND) | Driver allowance |
| revenue | int (VND) | = unit_price (client-facing revenue) |
| matched_work_order_ids | int[] | Work orders linked to this trip |
| status | `DRAFT` → `CONFIRMED` → `INVOICED` or `CANCELLED` | Lifecycle |

**Trip Order Lifecycle:**
```
Accountant creates TO → DRAFT
                          ↓ (confirm)
                     CONFIRMED
                          ↓ (issue invoice)
                     INVOICED

At any point → CANCELLED
```

**Business Rules:**
- A trip order represents **one container** movement (`container_number` is singular).
- A trip order can match **multiple work orders** (via `TripOrderWorkOrder` join table).
- When work orders are matched, their status is set to `MATCHED`.
- Salary recalculation is auto-triggered when trip order is created or when matched work orders change.

### 3.7 Reconciliation (Đối soát)

The process of matching Work Orders (physical reality from drivers) with Trip Orders (commercial records from accountants).

**Flow:**
1. Accountant selects a Work Order and a Trip Order
2. System links them via `TripOrderWorkOrder` join table
3. Work Order status → `MATCHED`
4. Work Order earning = Trip Order's `driver_salary + allowance`
5. Salary recalculation is auto-queued for the driver

**Rules:**
- A work order can only be matched once (status must not already be `MATCHED`).
- One trip order can match multiple work orders.
- Only accountants and superadmins can reconcile.

### 3.8 Salary (Lương tài xế)

#### Salary Period Config (Cấu hình kỳ lương)
Singleton config defining salary period boundaries.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| from_day | int (1–28) | Start day of each period |
| to_day | int (1–28) | End day of each period |

**Default:** 1st → 28th of each month.

**Cross-month periods:** If `from_day > to_day` (e.g., 26th → 25th), the period crosses month boundary. The system automatically computes the correct start/end dates.

#### Salary Period (Kỳ lương)
Calculated salary for a driver over a period.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| driver_id | int (FK) | Driver |
| driver_name | string | Denormalized |
| start_date | date | Period start |
| end_date | date | Period end |
| work_order_count | int | Number of MATCHED work orders in period |
| price_per_order | int (VND) | Average salary per order |
| total_salary | int (VND) | Sum of driver_salary from matched WOs |
| total_allowance | int (VND) | Sum of allowance from matched WOs |
| total_deduction | int (VND) | Deductions (currently always 0 — future feature) |
| net_pay | int (VND) | = total_salary + total_allowance - total_deduction |
| status | `OPEN` → `CALCULATED` → `PAID` | Lifecycle |

**Salary Lifecycle:**
```
OPEN → CALCULATED (auto-computed by worker) → PAID (accountant marks as paid)
```

**Business Rules:**
- Salary calculation is **async** (background worker via arq/Redis).
- Calculation counts only **MATCHED** work orders within the date range.
- Calculation is **upsert** — if a salary period already exists for (driver_id, start_date, end_date), it's recalculated.
- Auto-triggered when: trip order created, work orders matched to trip, or accountant manually requests calculation.
- `price_per_order = total_salary / work_order_count` (integer division).
- **Deductions not yet implemented** (total_deduction always 0) — future: fuel, fines, advances.

## 4. Workflows

### 4.1 Driver's Daily Workflow

```
1. Driver logs in → sees own dashboard with today's work orders
2. Driver taps "Create Work Order" → fills in:
   - Select client (or leave blank if unknown)
   - Enter route
   - Add container(s): number + type (E20/E40/F20/F40) + optional photo
   - GPS captured automatically
3. System auto-matches pricing if (client, work_type, route) found in Pricing table
4. Work order saved (offline-capable — queued if no network)
5. Driver can view own work history
```

### 4.2 Accountant's Daily Workflow

```
1. Accountant logs in → sees dashboard with stats
2. Manage clients, routes, pricings as needed
3. Create Trip Orders (commercial records):
   - Select client, driver, route, container, work type
   - Enter pricing (unit_price, driver_salary, allowance)
   - Optionally match with existing work orders
4. Reconcile unmatched work orders with trip orders
5. Calculate salary for drivers (manual trigger or auto)
6. Mark salary periods as PAID when driver is paid
```

### 4.3 Director's View

```
1. Director logs in → sees overview dashboard:
   - Total revenue, total expense, trip count
   - Outstanding debt (công nợ)
   - Per-driver salary breakdown
   - Per-client revenue breakdown
   - Unmatched work order count (needs reconciliation)
   - Pending trip count
2. View detailed client jobs (per-client history)
3. View detailed driver jobs (per-driver history)
4. Manage user accounts (create, edit, deactivate)
5. View notifications
```

### 4.4 SuperAdmin's View

```
1. Same as director + accountant combined
2. Can delete vendors, deactivate users
3. Full access to salary configuration
4. User management with role assignment
```

## 9. Key Business Calculations

### Revenue = Client pays Phúc Lộc
- `TripOrder.unit_price` (= `TripOrder.revenue`)

### Expense = Phúc Lộc pays driver
- `WorkOrder.driver_salary + WorkOrder.allowance` (= `WorkOrder.earning`)

### Profit per trip
- `TripOrder.unit_price - (WorkOrder.driver_salary + WorkOrder.allowance)`

### Driver salary for a period
- Sum of `WorkOrder.earning` for all MATCHED work orders within `[start_date, end_date]`
- `net_pay = total_salary + total_allowance - total_deduction`

### Outstanding debt (công nợ)
- `Client.outstanding_debt` — manual field, not auto-updated currently

---

## 10. Not Yet Implemented (Future)

These features are referenced in code comments or frontend TODOs but not yet built:

- [ ] **Auto-update outstanding_debt** — when trip order status → INVOICED, add to client's outstanding_debt
- [ ] **Deductions** — `total_deduction` in salary is always 0. Future: fuel, fines, advances
- [ ] **Invoice generation** — Trip Order → INVOICED status exists but no PDF/export
- [ ] **Push notifications** — ✅ Backend VAPID + push service ready. Frontend: profile dropdown has toggle, auto-subscribe on login, SW handles push events. Needs testing with actual notifications triggered by business events.
- [ ] **Vehicle management** — Tractor/trailer registry (currently just `tractor_plate` string on user)
- [ ] **Partner management** — Referenced in TODO comments
- [ ] **Expense tracking** — Referenced in TODO comments
- [ ] **Ledger/accounting** — Referenced in TODO comments
- [ ] **Monthly revenue chart** — `monthlyRevenue` field in dashboard API exists but returns empty array
- [ ] **Report generation** — Worker task `generate_monthly_report_task` exists but no UI trigger
